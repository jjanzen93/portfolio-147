				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project seeks to replicate the nostalgic carpets found in arcades from arcades of (relative) old.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I used the random seed to determine colors (from a selected list), shape orientation, location, and the amount. The stars were drawn using an example function from the p5.js documentation. The shapes respond to the mouse location using a helper function, which returns a map that takes in an upper and lower bound on scale size, as well as an interpretation of distance between the shapes and the cursor. </p>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Visual design is far and away my weakest area of design, both in enjoyment and skill. As such, this provided a significant challenge for me and took me far out of my comfort zone. I do feel like I did this project to the best of my ability, and connected what we were meant to do with an interesting and creative example to replicate.</p>
