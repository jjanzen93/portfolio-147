				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>This project seeks to emulate black and white images by placing triangles of random size, rotation, shade, location, and transparency. The program compares its own design to the pixel content of the reference image, mutating off of the design with the highest score. The annealing process can be automated by entering the amount of seconds, then slowly decreasing the mutation rate over that time after pressing the button.</p>
			</div>

			<div class="minor-section">
				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Triangles are stored as objects with attributes like rotation, size, shade, etc. These attributes are mutated off of the best design so far as determined by the mutation function, which takes in the current mutation rate percentage and gives an amount to mutate the values of the original design by. Annealing the image is done by taking in a time value in seconds, then mapping the rate from 100-0% over that given time. This manages big changes toward the beginning of the process, then slowly starts making more minor adjustments as a clearer image starts to take shape.</p>
			</div>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>It was fascinating to see the image slowly start to take shape as I adjusted parameters and waited for the program to figure it out. Having to assess a problem and define constraints to solve it was a good exercise in problem solving, like adjusting triangle size for more detail or increasing their number to cover the whole canvas. In the future, I would like to have a more specific idea of what I want to create to avoid getting bogged down in tiny adjustments that take a long time to observe the effects of.</p>
